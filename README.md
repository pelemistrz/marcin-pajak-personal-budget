# PersonalBudget Application

## Technologies Used:
- C++

## Description:
The **PersonalBudget** application is a tool designed to help users manage their finances by recording and tracking their income and expenses. It allows users to create accounts, add income and expenses with either the current date or a selected past date. The application then calculates the balance of the current month, the previous month, and for any selected period.

The application performs the following functions:
- Track income and expenses
- View the balance of the current month, previous month, or a custom date range
- Calculate the total income, expenses, and the difference between them (income - expenses)

All data is saved in an XML file, which serves as the database for the application. 

The application is entirely written in **C++**, utilizing the object-oriented programming paradigm, ensuring modularity and maintainability.

## Features:
- User account creation
- Add income and expenses with dates
- View balance for current, previous, and custom periods
- Automatically calculates total income, total expenses, and their difference
- Data storage in XML format
